# Create Viral Content

Make your posts spread. This skill turns forgettable drafts into content that gets shares, comments, and action.

## Core Principle: The Deliberative Refinement Loop

Good content doesn't come from one pass. You attack it, fix it, attack again:

1. Generate initial draft
2. Attack it from audience perspectives
3. Identify AI tells and weak points
4. Refine with human voice
5. Repeat until unbreakable

## The Anatomy of Viral Content

### Hook Architecture (First 2 Seconds)

**Pattern: Prediction + Stakes**
```
"I think [CONCEPT] is the [YEAR] [CATEGORY] that [OUTCOME]."
```
Example: "I think deliberative refinement is the 2026 prompt technique that matters most."

**Why it works:**
- "I think" = personal conviction, not corporate announcement
- Year = creates FOMO and timeframe
- Category = helps reader self-identify
- Outcome = stakes that matter

**Pattern: Tribal Identity Split**
```
"[TECHNIQUE] separates [WINNERS] from [EVERYONE ELSE]."
```
Example: "This separates serious builders from prompt tourists."

**Why it works:**
- Creates in-group/out-group
- Reader immediately picks a side
- Ego investment drives engagement

**Pattern: Before/After Compression**
```
"What used to require [OLD COMPLEXITY] now [NEW SIMPLICITY]."
```
Example: "What used to need 12 models chained together now takes one."

**Why it works:**
- Concrete efficiency gain
- "I had no idea" response
- Shareable stat

### Body Structure: The Build

**Required elements (in order):**
1. WHAT - Explain the concept (1-2 sentences max)
2. HOW - The mechanic with concrete examples
3. WHY NOW - The breakthrough that makes it possible
4. PAYOFF - What you can actually build/achieve

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Starting with "why it matters" before explaining "what it is"
- Generic benefits without specific mechanics
- Selling the sizzle before showing the steak

### Closer Architecture (Last 10%)

**Pattern: Command, Not Request**
```
BAD: "Try it. Change my mind."  (beggy, engagement bait)
GOOD: "Your next [ACTION] shouldn't [OLD WAY]. It should [NEW WAY]."
```
Example: "Your next prompt shouldn't ask for an answer. It should demand: 'Attack this from three expert perspectives, ground your claims, then revise.'"

**Why the command works:**
- Ends on authority, not weakness
- Gives immediate actionable next step
- Mirrors the thesis in its structure

## AI Tell Detection and Elimination

Kill these on sight:

### Transition Tells
- ❌ "Here's the wild part:"
- ❌ "Here's the thing:"
- ❌ "Let's dive in"
- ❌ "But here's the kicker:"
- ✅ Direct statement with no transition needed

### Enthusiasm Tells
- ❌ "I'm excited to share"
- ❌ "This is a game-changer"
- ❌ "Revolutionary"
- ✅ Let the content create excitement

### Structure Tells
- ❌ Numbered lists for everything
- ❌ "First... Second... Finally..."
- ❌ "In conclusion"
- ✅ Prose that flows naturally

### Engagement Bait Tells
- ❌ "Change my mind"
- ❌ "What do you think?"
- ❌ "Let me know in the comments"
- ✅ Strong closer that doesn't ask for permission

### Corporate Speaks
- ❌ "Leverage"
- ❌ "Utilize"  
- ❌ "Implement solutions"
- ✅ Plain verbs: use, try, build, ship

### Punctuation Tells (2024-2025)
- ❌ Em-dash overuse — like this — everywhere (max 1 per 500 words)
- ❌ Paragraphs starting with "However," "Moreover," "Overall,"
- ❌ Pleonasms: "true fact," "end result," "close proximity"
- ❌ Tautologies: "collaborate together," "revert back"
- ❌ Uniform sentence lengths (all 15-18 words)
- ✅ Vary punctuation, sentence length, and structure

## Platform-Specific Optimization

### Reddit
**Title patterns that work:**
- Hot Take: [Contrarian Position]
- [Technique]: Why [Common Practice] is dead in [YEAR]
- The [category] technique that [concrete result]
- Stop [old behavior]. [New behavior] is the [year] meta.

**Body guidelines:**
- 200-400 words optimal
- Use bold for section headers sparingly
- End with TL;DR that's actually quotable
- Don't ask "what do you think?" - invite specific discussion

**Subreddit calibration:**
- r/MachineLearning: Technical, invite discussion, conservative claims
- r/ChatGPT: Practical, show the meta shift, power-user focus
- r/singularity: Hype-friendly, maximum viral coefficient
- r/LocalLLaMA: Add self-hosting angle
- Hacker News: "Show HN:" format, understate rather than overstate

### YouTube Comments
**Constraints:** ~500 chars, must hook in first line, no formatting
**Pattern:**
```
[Bold claim in first sentence]. [Mechanic in 2 sentences]. [Why now]. [Call to action or quotable closer].
```

### Twitter/X Threads
**Thread structure:**
1. Hook tweet (standalone viral potential)
2. "Here's how:" transition
3. 3-5 mechanic tweets
4. Payoff/result tweet
5. Call-to-action tweet

**Per-tweet rules:**
- Each tweet must standalone
- No "1/" numbering (algorithmic penalty)
- Use line breaks for readability
- End threads with something quotable

### LinkedIn
**Patterns that perform:**
- Personal story + professional lesson
- "Unpopular opinion:" framing
- Contrarian take on industry norm
- Before/after transformation

**Avoid:**
- Pure promotional content
- Asking for engagement explicitly
- Hashtag stuffing

### TikTok
**Hook constraints:** 1-3 seconds to capture, sound-off viewing common

**High-performing hooks:**
- Curiosity: "Most people don't know [surprising fact]..."
- Problem: "If you struggle with [problem], watch this..."
- Result: "I tried [thing] for [time]. Here's what happened..."
- Controversy: "This is why everyone is wrong about [topic]..."

**Caption optimization:**
- Keywords in first 3 words
- 5-10 words optimal
- Hashtags at end, not stuffed

### Instagram Reels
**Constraints:** Vertical 9:16, auto-play, first frame critical

**Thumbnail (cover) matters less than:**
- First frame visual hook
- Text overlay in first 2 seconds
- Pattern interrupt opening

**Carousel posts:**
- First slide: Hook with curiosity gap
- Middle slides: Value delivery
- Last slide: Quotable statement or CTA

### Email Subject Lines
**Optimal length:** 30-50 characters (mobile-first)

**High-performing patterns:**
- Curiosity: "Is this why your [metric] is stuck?"
- Personal: "[Name], noticed you haven't tried this"
- Value: "Get 2x [outcome] with one tweak"

**Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ ALL CAPS urgency
- ❌ "Quick question" (when it's not)
- ❌ Emoji overload 🚀🔥💡

## The Humanization Pass

Done with structure? Run **humanize-writing** to polish the voice. Same viral hooks, human delivery.

### Automatic Integration

If you've got both skills, call humanize-writing directly:

```
Apply the humanize-writing skill to this draft. Focus on:
- Removing AI vocabulary tells from the content
- Ensuring natural sentence rhythm 
- Maintaining the viral hooks I've established
```

### Manual Humanization Checklist

No humanize-writing? Run this instead:

1. **Read aloud test**: Does it sound like a human talking to a friend at a bar?
2. **Transition audit**: Remove every "Here's the thing" type phrase
3. **Enthusiasm check**: Delete excitement language, keep exciting content
4. **Specificity check**: Replace every generic noun with a concrete example
5. **Length check**: Cut 20% - viral content is always shorter than the draft

### Platform-Specific Humanization Calibration

| Platform | Humanization Level | Formality Target |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Reddit | High | Casual expert |
| LinkedIn | Medium | Professional but warm |
| Twitter/X | Medium-High | Punchy, fragmentary OK |
| YouTube | High | Accessible, conversational |
| Hacker News | Medium | Technical, understated |

### Quantitative Thresholds for Viral Content

Check these numbers after humanizing:

- **Hook strength**: First sentence must create curiosity or stakes
- **AI tells**: Zero tolerance for blacklisted phrases (see `resources/ai-tells.md`)
- **Word count**: Platform-specific (Reddit: 200-400, Twitter: <280 per tweet)
- **Specificity ratio**: ≥1 concrete example per abstract claim
- **Closer strength**: Must end on authority, not request

## Ethical Framework

### Legitimate Uses
- Optimizing your own content for maximum social reach
- Improving engagement for genuine value propositions
- Learning viral content mechanics for personal skill development
- Making AI-generated content pass hostile audience scrutiny

### Illegitimate Uses
- Astroturfing or coordinated inauthentic behavior
- Spreading misinformation with viral mechanics
- Impersonating others' expertise or voice
- Engagement farming without substance

### Disclosure Guidance
- **Required**: When promoting products/services you're paid for
- **Recommended**: When AI assisted in content generation
- **Not required**: For general content creation and ideation

## Voice Calibration

**Match formality to platform:**
- Reddit: Casual expert (bar conversation with someone smart)
- LinkedIn: Professional but not corporate
- Twitter: Punchy, fragmentary ok
- YouTube: Accessible, can be slightly more casual

**Confidence calibration:**
- Overconfident = gets attacked in comments
- Underconfident = doesn't spread
- Target: Strong conviction + specific evidence

## Title Generation

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Titles determine 70% of content performance. Consult `resources/viral-titles.md` and `resources/title-formulas.md` for 50+ formulas.

### Research-Backed Title Rules
- **Optimal length:** 11 words / 65 characters (BuzzSumo 100M study)
- **Magic number:** 10 performs best; odd numbers beat even
- **Negative superlatives:** +63% CTR vs positive (Outbrain)
- **Specific numbers:** $1,247 beats $1,000

### Quick Formulas (Generate 25+, Pick Best)

**Curiosity-Gap:** "What [group] won't tell you about [topic]"
**Contrarian:** "[Common belief] is dead. Here's what's next."
**Listicle:** "[Number] ways to [achieve X] without [sacrifice]"
**How-To:** "How to [achieve X] in [timeframe] (step-by-step)"
**Prediction:** "[Concept] is the [year] [category] that [outcome]"
**Negative:** "[Number] [topic] mistakes destroying your [metric]"

### Title Scoring (Target: 7+)
| Criteria | Score 0-3 |
|----------|-----------|
| Curiosity | "Must know" feeling? |
| Specificity | Numbers, metrics? |
| Emotion | High-arousal trigger? |

## Thumbnail Design

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Thumbnails drive 70%+ of video performance. Consult `resources/viral-thumbnails.md` and `resources/thumbnail-checklist.md` for design protocols.

### Research-Backed Thumbnail Rules
- **Face CTR boost:** +35-50% (neuroscience: amygdala activation)
- **Decision time:** 1.8 seconds average (Netflix study)
- **82%** of browsing time spent on thumbnails
- **Custom thumbnails:** 90% of top videos use them

### Quick Checklist
- [ ] Face with clear expression (shock/surprise = highest CTR)
- [ ] Maximum 3 elements in frame ("Limit Your Lamborghinis")
- [ ] High contrast colors (test in dark mode)
- [ ] Text: 3-4 words max, bold sans-serif
- [ ] Mobile test (legible at 120px width)
- [ ] Title synergy (complement, don't duplicate)

### AI Thumbnail Prompt
```
[person] with [shocked/surprised] expression, close-up portrait,
[vibrant color] background, studio lighting, high contrast,
YouTube thumbnail style, clean composition, no text
```

## Refinement Protocol

Before you ship, attack the draft:

**Pass 1: The Skeptic**
"Why should I care? What's actually new here?"

**Pass 2: The Expert**  
"Is this technically accurate? What would an expert nitpick?"

**Pass 3: The Scroller**
"Would I stop scrolling for this? What's the hook?"

**Pass 4: The Competitor**
"How is this different from the 10 similar posts?"

**Pass 5: The Editor**
"What can I cut without losing meaning?"

## Examples

### Bad → Good Transformation

**Before (AI-generated feel):**
```
I'm excited to share a revolutionary new productivity hack that will 
change your workflow forever. Here's the thing: most people waste hours 
on email. Let's dive into how inbox zero can transform your day. First, 
you batch process. Second, you use templates. Finally, you schedule 
check-ins. What do you think?
```

**After (human voice):**
```
Email before noon is self-sabotage. Tested this for 3 weeks. No inbox 
until 2pm. My deep work hours went from 2 to 4+. That 7:47am Slack 
ping? Not your fire. Morning brain builds. Afternoon brain reacts. 
Flip the order and you're always playing defense. Two inbox windows: 
2pm and 5pm. Handles everything that actually matters.
```

**What changed:**
- Removed enthusiasm tells ("excited to share", "revolutionary")
- Removed transition tells ("Here's the thing", "Let's dive in")
- Removed structure tells ("First... Second... Finally...")
- Removed engagement bait ("What do you think?")
- Added concrete metrics (3 weeks, 2 to 4+ hours, 7:47am)
- Used contractions ("I", "you're", "That's")
- Varied sentence length (4 words to 15 words)
- Strong conviction opener instead of hedged announcement
