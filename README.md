## Integration with humanize-writing Skill

This skill integrates with the **humanize-writing** skill for the final polish pass. When both skills are installed, viral-content-forge automatically invokes humanize-writing to:

- Remove AI vocabulary tells
- Ensure natural sentence rhythm
- Maintain viral hooks while sounding human

### Manual Fallback

If humanize-writing is unavailable, the skill includes a built-in humanization checklist.

## Examples

**Before (AI-generated):**
> I'm excited to share a revolutionary new approach to prompt engineering. Here's the thing: traditional single-pass prompting is limited...

**After (humanized viral):**
> I think deliberative refinement is the 2026 prompt technique that matters most. The core idea: you don't ask AI for an answer—you make it defend one...

## Ethical Framework

✅ **Do:** Polish your own ideas, convert expertise to accessible content, learn viral mechanics

❌ **Don't:** Astroturf, spread misinformation, impersonate others, engagement farm without substance
