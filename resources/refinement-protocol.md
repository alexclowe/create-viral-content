# Refinement Protocol

The difference between forgettable content and viral content is the number of adversarial passes.

## The Five-Pass Protocol

Every piece of content gets attacked from five perspectives before shipping.

### Pass 1: The Skeptic
**Voice:** "Why should I care? What's actually new here?"

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this just restating obvious things?
- What's the genuine insight vs padding?
- Would someone who knows this space learn anything?
- Is there a "so what?" after reading this?

**Actions:**
- Kill any section that doesn't survive "so what?"
- Strengthen claims with specific evidence
- Remove content that's true but not new

### Pass 2: The Expert
**Voice:** "Is this technically accurate? What would I nitpick?"

**Questions to ask:**
- Are there any claims that oversimplify?
- Would someone with deep expertise disagree?
- Are the examples technically correct?
- Is anything stated more confidently than warranted?

**Actions:**
- Correct any technical errors
- Add nuance where oversimplification would get called out
- Remove overconfident claims that can't be defended
- Strengthen examples with accurate details

### Pass 3: The Scroller
**Voice:** "Would I stop scrolling for this? What's the hook?"

**Questions to ask:**
- Does the first sentence create curiosity?
- Is the value obvious in the first 5 seconds?
- Does the structure invite reading vs skipping?
- Is there a payoff that justifies the read?

**Actions:**
- Rewrite first sentence until it hooks
- Front-load value proposition
- Remove any slow warmup content
- Ensure clear payoff visible early
Finally, run a **Deliberative Refinement** pass on the complete script.

### Pass 4: The Competitor
**Voice:** "How is this different from the 10 similar posts?"

**Questions to ask:**
- What makes this unique?
- Is this saying something others aren't?
- Would this stand out in a feed of similar content?
- Is there a novel angle or framing?

**Actions:**
- Sharpen the unique angle
- Remove anything that sounds like every other post
- Add novel perspective or evidence
- Make the differentiation explicit in the hook

### Pass 5: The Editor
**Voice:** "What can I cut without losing meaning?"

**Questions to ask:**
- Is every sentence earning its place?
- Are there any filler phrases?
- Can any point be made more concisely?
- What would tightening by 20% look like?

**Actions:**
- Cut every filler phrase
- Combine redundant points
- Shorten every sentence that allows it
- Kill any section that's padding

## Protocol Execution

### Quick Protocol (5-10 minutes)
For comments, short posts, low-stakes content:
- Mental run-through of each pass
- Focus on Passes 1, 3, and 5
- One revision cycle

### Standard Protocol (15-30 minutes)
For Reddit posts, significant comments, professional content:
- Written notes for each pass
- All five passes with revisions
- Two revision cycles
- Humanization checklist (see ai-tells.md)

### Deep Protocol (1+ hours)
For flagship content, threads, important announcements:
- Full written critique for each pass
- Multiple revision cycles per pass
- External review if possible
- Bar test with actual human
- 24-hour cooling period before publish

## Pass Sequencing

Always run in this order:

1. **Skeptic first** - No point polishing content that has no value
2. **Expert second** - Accuracy matters before optimization
3. **Scroller third** - Hook only matters if content is solid
4. **Competitor fourth** - Differentiation requires strong foundation
5. **Editor last** - Cutting is the final step

## Common Failure Modes

### Skipping the Skeptic
**Symptom:** Content sounds good but says nothing
**Fix:** Always ask "what's the actual insight?" first

### Expert Paralysis
**Symptom:** So much hedging content loses its punch
**Fix:** Accuracy matters, but so does conviction

### Hook Without Substance
**Symptom:** Great first line, disappointing follow-through
**Fix:** Build body before obsessing over hook

### Differentiation Without Value
**Symptom:** Novel angle on uninteresting topic
**Fix:** Skeptic pass before Competitor pass

### Over-Editing
**Symptom:** Content feels sterile, voice is gone
**Fix:** Preserve one distinctive voice element per revision

## Stopping Criteria

Content is ready when:
- [ ] Survives Skeptic's "so what?"
- [ ] Expert can't find inaccuracies
- [ ] Scroller would stop for the hook
- [ ] Competitor sees clear differentiation
- [ ] Editor can't cut more without losing value
- [ ] Passes humanization checklist (ai-tells.md)
- [ ] Bar test passed (would say this to a friend)

If all boxes checked, ship it. Perfectionism beyond this point has diminishing returns.

## Thumbnail Refinement Protocol

### Pass 1: Expression Quality
**Voice:** "Would I stop scrolling for this face?"

**Questions:**
- Is the expression instantly readable?
- Does it create curiosity or emotional response?
- Is the face clear at mobile thumbnail size?

**Actions:**
- Reshoot if expression is neutral or unclear
- Adjust lighting if face lacks pop
- Try more exaggerated versions

### Pass 2: Composition Clarity
**Voice:** "Can I understand this in 0.5 seconds?"

**Questions:**
- Are there more than 3 elements?
- Is the focal point obvious?
- Does the composition follow rule of thirds?

**Actions:**
- Remove any element that isn't essential
- Reposition subject off-center for dynamism
- Add negative space where needed

### Pass 3: Color and Contrast
**Voice:** "Does this pop against the YouTube feed?"

**Questions:**
- Is there enough contrast between elements?
- Does it work in dark mode?
- Are colors saturated enough to stand out?

**Actions:**
- Increase saturation/vibrance
- Add subtle glow or outline to subject
- Test against dark background

### Pass 4: Text Integration
**Voice:** "Is the text readable at 120px width?"

**Questions:**
- Is text 3-4 words maximum?
- Does it complement (not duplicate) title?
- Is font bold and sans-serif?

**Actions:**
- Reduce word count if too long
- Increase font size if too small
- Add outline/shadow for readability

### Pass 5: Mobile Test
**Voice:** "Would this work on a phone screen?"

**Actions:**
- View at 120x67px
- If ANY element is unclear, simplify
- If text is unreadable, remove or enlarge

## Title A/B Testing Protocol

### Before Publishing
1. Generate 20+ title variations using different formulas
2. Score top 5 using Curiosity + Specificity + Emotion matrix
3. Select best 2-3 for A/B testing

### Testing Execution
1. Use YouTube's Test & Compare or TubeBuddy
2. Run for minimum 7 days
3. Require 1,000+ impressions per variant
4. Monitor CTR and watch time together

### Post-Test Analysis
1. Document winning pattern
2. Identify what made the difference
3. Apply learning to future titles
4. Build personal formula library
