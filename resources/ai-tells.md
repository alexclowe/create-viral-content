# AI Tells: Complete Detection Guide

This reference catalogs patterns that signal AI-generated content. Use during the humanization pass to hunt and eliminate.

## Transition Phrases

These phrases scream "ChatGPT wrote this":

| AI Tell | Human Alternative |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Here's the wild part:" | [Just state it directly] |
| "Here's the thing:" | [Remove entirely] |
| "Let's dive in" | [Start with substance] |
| "But here's the kicker:" | [Direct statement] |
| "Here's what's interesting:" | [Remove, let interest emerge] |
| "The key takeaway is:" | [Integrate into flow] |
| "What's fascinating is:" | [Remove fascination claims] |
| "Buckle up" | [Never use this] |
| "Let me explain" | [Just explain] |
| "First things first" | [Start with the first thing] |

## Enthusiasm Tells

AI compensates for lack of genuine insight with enthusiasm. Remove:

- "I'm excited to share"
- "This is a game-changer"
- "Revolutionary"
- "Groundbreaking"
- "Transformative"
- "Mind-blowing"
- "Incredible"
- "Amazing"
- "Powerful" (when describing concepts)
- "Leveraging the power of"

**Rule:** If you have to tell readers something is exciting, it isn't.

## Structure Tells

AI defaults to rigid organization:

- "First... Second... Third... Finally..."
- Numbered lists for prose content
- "In conclusion"
- "To summarize"
- "Let's break this down"
- "There are X key points"
- Excessive bullet points
- Headers for every paragraph

**Human pattern:** Prose flows. Structure serves meaning, not vice versa.

## Corporate Speak

AI training on corporate documents creates these:

| AI Term | Human Alternative |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Leverage" | use |
| "Utilize" | use |
| "Implement" | build, try, do |
| "Facilitate" | help, enable |
| "Optimize" | improve |
| "Streamline" | simplify |
| "Robust" | strong, solid |
| "Scalable" | grows, handles more |
| "Ecosystem" | system, tools |
| "Synergy" | [delete word entirely] |
| "Best practices" | what works |
| "Moving forward" | next |
| "At the end of the day" | [remove] |
| "Touch base" | talk, check in |
| "Deep dive" | look closely, examine |

## Engagement Bait

Phrases that signal "I was trained to generate engagement":

- "Change my mind"
- "What do you think?"
- "Let me know in the comments"
- "Drop a 🔥 if you agree"
- "Share if this resonated"
- "Tag someone who needs this"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "Am I the only one who thinks..."

**Better approach:** End with a strong statement or actionable command.

## Hedging Patterns

AI over-hedges to seem balanced:

- "It's worth noting that..."
- "That being said..."
- "On the other hand..."
- "While this isn't for everyone..."
- "Your mileage may vary"
- "Of course, there are exceptions"
- "To be fair..."

**When to hedge:** Only when the nuance genuinely matters.

## Filler Phrases

Padding that adds no meaning:

- "It goes without saying"
- "Needless to say"
- "As we all know"
- "At the core"
- "Fundamentally"
- "Essentially"
- "Basically"
- "In essence"
- "When it comes to"
- "In terms of"
- "As a matter of fact"

**Rule:** If you can remove it and lose nothing, remove it.

## Meta-Commentary

AI explains what it's doing:

- "I'll explain how..."
- "Let me walk you through..."
- "Here's a breakdown of..."
- "This post will cover..."
- "In this thread, I'll..."
- "I want to share..."

**Human pattern:** Just do the thing. Don't announce it.

## Emoji Overuse

AI-generated social content often:

- Uses emojis as bullet points
- Starts every line with an emoji
- Uses 🚀 and 💡 and 🔥 excessively
- Treats emojis as punctuation

**Human pattern:** Emojis are seasoning, not the main dish. 0-2 per post max on most platforms.

## The "Sounds Smart" Trap

Phrases AI uses to seem intellectual:

- "paradigm shift"
- "framework for thinking about"
- "mental model"
- "first principles"
- "unlock"
- "supercharge"
- "10x"
- "level up"

**When acceptable:** Only when the concept genuinely fits and you're not using it as a crutch.

## Detection Heuristic

Read your content aloud. If you wouldn't say it to a friend at a bar, rewrite it.

**Bar test examples:**

❌ "I'm excited to share a revolutionary framework that leverages AI to optimize your workflow. Here's the thing: traditional approaches are fundamentally flawed. Let me break this down..."

✅ "So there's this technique where you make AI argue with itself before accepting an answer. Used to need like twelve different models to pull off. Now one model does it all. Way better results."

## Humanization Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] No transition tells in first paragraph
- [ ] No enthusiasm adjectives
- [ ] No corporate verbs
- [ ] No engagement bait closer
- [ ] No meta-commentary about what you're sharing
- [ ] No excessive structure/numbering
- [ ] Passes the bar test
- [ ] Would not embarrass you if read aloud

## The Complete Detection Heuristic

**For text content:** Read aloud. Would you say this to a friend at a bar?

**For video content:** Watch muted first 3 seconds. Would you stop scrolling?

**For thumbnails:** View at 100px width. Is the message still clear?

**For titles:** Remove your topic. Does the structure still feel generic?

## Punctuation Antipatterns (2024-2025)

> **Research basis:** Cambridge University 2024, Originality.ai detection data. For the full comprehensive list, see the **humanize-writing** skill's `references/ai-vocabulary-list.md`.

### Em-Dash Overuse
AI (especially ChatGPT) overuses long dashes — like this — to add dramatic pauses.
- **Threshold:** Max 1 per 500 words
- **Fix:** Use commas or restructure

### Paragraph Starters
AI starts paragraphs with these + comma:
- ❌ "However, ..."
- ❌ "Moreover, ..."
- ❌ "Overall, ..."
- ❌ "Furthermore, ..."
- ❌ "Importantly, ..."
- ✅ Integrate contrast mid-sentence or delete

### Pleonasms (Redundant Words)
| ❌ AI Pattern | ✅ Fix |
|--------------|--------|
| "true fact" | "fact" |
| "end result" | "result" |
| "final outcome" | "outcome" |
| "completely eliminate" | "eliminate" |
| "close proximity" | "nearby" |

### Tautologies (Same Thing Twice)
| ❌ AI Pattern | ✅ Fix |
|--------------|--------|
| "collaborate together" | "collaborate" |
| "join together" | "join" |
| "revert back" | "revert" |
| "repeat again" | "repeat" |

### Burstiness (Sentence Variation)
AI produces uniform sentence lengths. Humans vary dramatically.
- **AI Pattern:** All sentences 15-18 words
- **Human Pattern:** Mix of 4-word punches and 25-word flows
- **Fix:** Add fragments. "Not everything needs a verb. Sometimes just a phrase."

### Oxford Comma Consistency
AI always uses Oxford comma. Humans are inconsistent.
- **AI:** "red, white, and blue" (every time)
- **Human:** Sometimes "red, white and blue"
- **Fix:** Occasional variation is authentic

### Multi-syllable Word Overuse
AI prefers Latin-root words:
| ❌ AI | ✅ Human |
|------|---------|
| "utilize" | "use" |
| "demonstrate" | "show" |
| "facilitate" | "help" |
| "approximately" | "about" |

**Threshold:** Multi-syllable words <20% of vocabulary.
