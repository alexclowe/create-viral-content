# Platform Templates and Examples

## Reddit Post Templates

### The Hot Take
```markdown
**Hot Take: [Contrarian Position]**

[Counter to conventional wisdom in 1 sentence].

**The core idea:** [What the technique/concept actually is in 1-2 sentences]

**How it works:**
- [Mechanism point 1 - concrete, specific]
- [Mechanism point 2 - concrete, specific]  
- [Mechanism point 3 - concrete, specific]

[Breakthrough/efficiency gain in 1-2 sentences]

**Why this matters:** [Payoff - what you can actually build/ship]

**TL;DR:** [Quotable one-liner that could go viral alone]
```

### The Technique Post
```markdown
**[Technique Name]: [Result it enables]**

[Problem statement everyone recognizes in 1 sentence].

**[Technique Name] solves this by:**
[2-3 sentence explanation of the mechanic]

[Historical context - what it used to require]

[Breakthrough that makes it possible now]

**The results:**
[Concrete outcomes - docs that survive review, code that works, etc.]

**TL;DR:** [Technique] = [mechanic in plain language]. [Before/after comparison]. [Strong closer statement].
```

### The Discovery Post
```markdown
**[What You Found]: [Why It Matters]**

[Setup - what you were trying to do in 1 sentence].

[Discovery - what you found that was unexpected]

**What changed:**
[Before state] → [After state]

[Why this works - the underlying principle]

[What you can now do that you couldn't before]

I've been using this for [use cases]. [Results].

**TL;DR:** [Discovery in one sentence]. [Implication in one sentence].
```

## YouTube Comment Template

**Constraints:** ~500 characters, must hook in first line

```
[Bold claim - the hook]. The core idea: [mechanic in 1 sentence]. [How it works in 1-2 sentences with concrete example]. [Breakthrough - what changed]. [Result/payoff]. [Quotable closer].
```

**Example:**
```
I think deliberative refinement is the 2026 prompt technique that matters most. The core idea: you don't ask AI for an answer—you make it defend one. Run your draft through multiple rounds where the AI critiques itself from different expert angles, grounds every claim with evidence between passes, revises until only surviving ideas remain. Six months ago this required 12+ models. Now one model does it. Same quality, fraction of complexity.
```

## Twitter/X Thread Template

**Thread structure (each tweet must standalone):**

**Tweet 1 - Hook:**
```
[Bold claim that creates curiosity]

[Why this matters in one line]

🧵
```

**Tweet 2 - Setup:**
```
The problem:

[What everyone's doing wrong in 2-3 lines]
```

**Tweet 3 - Mechanic:**
```
The fix:

[Core technique in 2-3 lines]

[One concrete example]
```

**Tweet 4 - Depth:**
```
How it actually works:

[Step 1]
[Step 2]  
[Step 3]

Each pass makes it sharper.
```

**Tweet 5 - Proof:**
```
I've been using this for [timeframe].

Results:
• [Concrete outcome 1]
• [Concrete outcome 2]
• [Concrete outcome 3]
```

**Tweet 6 - Closer:**
```
[Strong declarative statement about the shift]

[Quotable one-liner people will screenshot]
```

## LinkedIn Post Template

```
[Hook - contrarian take or surprising insight]

[Personal context - brief story or observation that led to this]

[The insight - what you learned/discovered]

[Why it matters - implications for the reader]

[Call to action - not engagement bait, but actual next step]
```

**Example structure:**
```
Unpopular opinion: [Contrarian take]

I used to think [old belief]. Then [what happened].

Here's what I learned:

[Insight 1 - specific, concrete]
[Insight 2 - specific, concrete]
[Insight 3 - specific, concrete]

The shift: [Before state] → [After state]

If you're [target audience], [specific recommendation].
```

## Hook Patterns with Examples

### Pattern 1: Prediction + Stakes
**Template:** "I think [CONCEPT] is the [YEAR] [CATEGORY] that [OUTCOME]."

**Examples:**
- "I think deliberative refinement is the 2026 prompt technique that matters most."
- "I think structured output is the 2025 API feature that separates production apps from demos."
- "I think context windows are the 2026 bottleneck that kills most agent architectures."

### Pattern 2: Tribal Split
**Template:** "[TECHNIQUE] separates [WINNERS] from [EVERYONE ELSE]."

**Examples:**
- "This separates serious builders from prompt tourists."
- "This is what separates shipped products from eternal prototypes."
- "This separates engineers from script kiddies."

### Pattern 3: Before/After Compression
**Template:** "What used to require [OLD COMPLEXITY] now [NEW SIMPLICITY]."

**Examples:**
- "What used to need 12 models chained together now takes one."
- "What used to require a PhD now fits in a weekend project."
- "What used to cost $10k/month now runs on a $5 VPS."

### Pattern 4: The Inversion
**Template:** "Stop [COMMON ACTION]. Start [BETTER ACTION]."

**Examples:**
- "Stop asking AI for answers. Start making it defend them."
- "Stop optimizing prompts. Start optimizing validation."
- "Stop building features. Start building systems."

### Pattern 5: The Death Declaration
**Template:** "[COMMON PRACTICE] is dead. [NEW PARADIGM] is the new standard."

**Examples:**
- "Single-pass prompting is dead. Deliberative refinement is the new standard."
- "RAG is dead. Agentic retrieval is the new standard."
- "Fine-tuning is dead. In-context learning is the new standard."

## TL;DR Formulas

**Formula 1: Definition + Compression + Outcome**
```
[Concept] = [definition in plain language]. [Before/after]. [Result].
```
Example: "Deliberative refinement = force AI through multiple expert critique rounds with fact-checking between passes. What used to need 12 models now needs 1. Outputs go from 'sounds right' to 'is right.'"

**Formula 2: Command + Mechanic + Stakes**
```
[Do this] instead of [that]. [How]. [Why it matters].
```
Example: "Make AI defend its answers instead of just generating them. Attack from multiple angles, ground with evidence, iterate until unbreakable. This is how you ship docs that actually survive review."

**Formula 3: Comparison + Implication**
```
[Old way] optimizes for [weak outcome]. [New way] optimizes for [strong outcome].
```
Example: "Single-pass prompting optimizes for 'sounds right.' Deliberative refinement optimizes for 'survives contact with reality.'"
